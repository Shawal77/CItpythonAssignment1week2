'''Interactive quiz Python Project
Create a program that asks the user a series of questions.
Each question should have a multiple choice answer.
The user should be able to type in the letter of the
answer they think is correct. After all the questions
have been asked, the program should tell the user how
many they got correct and what the correct answers were.'''
